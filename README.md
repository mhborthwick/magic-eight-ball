# Magic 8-Ball!

Hi! I'm a small magic 8-ball app! I don't do a lot yet, or work very well. Maybe
you can help?

## To Run Me At All

Once you've cloned me, `cd` into me and run me like this!

```shell
python3 magic.py
```

## ...but I need work!

Like I say: I'm pretty new to this Magic 8-Ball thing, and I'm not great at it.
Here are some things I know I need help with:

1. More fortunes! I only really know three -- and I'm not called the "Magic
   3-Ball," so it's a little embarrassing ʕ￫ᴥ￩　ʔ
2. Also I might have a bug? Everything always seems so cloudy. Can you help?
3. People ask me their questions, but then I don't really _remember_ the
   question, or do anything with it. It'd be way more fun if I did something
   _fun_ with what people tell me!

Also, if anyone were feeling *really* helpful, I wish I could check if a
question were _really_ a question -- right now I can't tell.
